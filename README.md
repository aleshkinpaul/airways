### Page layout (150/150)

General Requirements:

- [x] The web app must be responsive, i.e., it should adapt to various screen sizes and resolutions, such as desktops,
  laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
- [x] The web app should follow the same style guide across all the pages, including the color scheme, typography, and
  visual elements.
- [x] All the forms should have client-side validation that prevents submission and shows invalid fields if any of the
  required data is missing. The validation rule should correspond to the expected data type (e.g. email, phone number,
  name, etc.)

Header:

- [x] The header should be fixed and visible at all times, even when scrolling down the page.
- [x] The logo should be a clickable link that takes the user to the home page.
- [x] The progress bar indicator. It’s visible if a booking is in progress. Indicates the current step.
- [x] The date format dropdown and currency dropdown that applies preference settings and will change the date or
  currency format accordingly across the entire application
- [x] The log-in button should trigger a modal or popup window that allows users to create a new account or log in using
  their existing credentials.
- [x] The log-in button is displayed only for an anonymous user
- [x] The user account button takes to the “User Account Page” and is displayed instead of the log-in button if a user
  is authenticated
- [x]  The shopping cart icon for authenticated users takes to the “Shopping Cart Page”

Content Container:

  main content of the web page, such as flight search results, flight details, booking form, payment form, etc.

Footer:

- [x] Includes the copyright text and payment method logos
- [x] You can include a piece of brief information about developers (name, avatar, GitHub link) that were working on the
  project

### User authentication (40/50)

- [x] The app should provide a user registration flow that guides the user through the process of creating an account.
  The flow should include two tabs - "Login" and "Sign Up."


- Login tab:

- [x] The "Login" tab should allow users to sign in to their existing account by providing their email and password. In
  case of incorrect credentials, the app should alert the user about entering the wrong username or password.

- Sign Up tab:

- [x] The "Sign Up" tab should allow users to create a new account by providing their email, password, first name, last
  name, date of birth, gender, phone number, and citizenship.
- [ ] Users should also have the option to sign up using social networks which are not supposed to be a fully
  functioning OAuth solution: it could be used to pre-fill the registration
  form `Doesn't work for deploy - Completed with Google OAuth2 - After authorization with Google, the next step is to click on the Google authorization button. This will automatically populate the form fields with the user's name and email information.`
- [x] Form validation: The registration form should have validation rules in place to ensure that all required fields
  are filled in, the name field doesn't contain numbers, the email address is valid, and the phone number is in the
  correct format.
- [x] Acknowledgment of terms and conditions: The registration form should include a checkmark to indicate that the user
  acknowledges the terms and conditions. The submission is possible only after checking the checkbox.

  process.
